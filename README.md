# Labber

Labber is a 2d platformer game, where a player can collect functions, numbers, and operators that alter those functions. To give their character different abilities which enable the mto move around the map in different ways. 

It was created by Ryan Gardener, Jonas Kunz, and Mike Dragert as our final project at lighthouse labs. We utilized React, Node Js, and Phaser Primarily as our frontend, and Ruby on Rails, and Postgresql for our backend.
We decided to split the project into two repositories, this one where the frontend is and [Our Backend Repo](https://github.com/GardRyan/backend-phaser-game) which we used for our databse and server.

The frontend of the game was built on the Phaser React template available on the Phaser github, though we heavily modifed it and added a lot of new stuff to it.

We had a lot of fun learning Phaser, a completley new framework for us and experimenting and solving problems to make our little game.

In the future we would like to work some more on the game, and polish some existing features, and add new ones like more puzzles, different functions etc..

## Phaser React Template

This is a Phaser 3 project template that uses the React framework and Vite for bundling. It includes a bridge for React to Phaser game communication, hot-reloading for quick development workflow and scripts to generate production-ready builds.

**[This Template is also available as a TypeScript version.](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react-ts)**

### Versions

This template has been updated for:

- [Phaser 3.80.1](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)
- [React 18.2.0](https://github.com/facebook/react)
